# Guess Pokémon Game

Here you could find a little example of PokeApi implementation to show a list of Pokémon and guess the name of the
Pokémon. All is implemented with vue, and you could find an example of how to use the PokeApi with vue. I tried to
include just a basic configuration of vue and webpack to make it easy to understand.
